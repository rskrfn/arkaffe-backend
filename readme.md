In the current pandemic, business processes are required to keep running so they don't die. However, when the business process is running, it is necessary to pay attention to the health and safety of employees. One of them is by reducing physical contact between customers and employees. Therefore, a system was created to solve these problems. We created the Arkaffe system, which with this system reduces physical contact.
